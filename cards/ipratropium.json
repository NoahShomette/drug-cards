        "[AR4] Patients may require more than 3 nebulizer treatments, treatments should continue until improvement. Following 3 combination nebulizers (DuoNeb), it is preferable to continue albuterol solely with subsequent treatments as there is no proven benefit to continual use of ipratropium.",
        "Due to the risk of inadvertent topical administration (of the nebulization preparation), ipratropium should be used with caution in patients with narrowangle glaucoma",
        "Metered-dose-inhaler ipratropium preparations may include allergens contraindicating use in patients with soy or nut allergies.",
        "Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur in a small percentage of patients who receive ipratropium. A proposed etiology is attributed to other compounds in the ipratropium preparation. If paradoxical bronchospasm (evidenced by significantly increased and severe bronchospasm following administration) is suspected, discontinue use."
