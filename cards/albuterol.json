        "[AR4] Patients may require more than 3 nebulizer treatments, treatments should continue until improvement. Following 3 combination nebulizers (DuoNeb), it is preferable to continue albuterol solely with subsequent treatments as there is no proven benefit to continual use of ipratropium.",

        "Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur in a small percentage of patients who receive albuterol. A proposed etiology is attributed to other compounds in the albuterol preparation. If paradoxical bronchospasm (evidenced by significantly increased and severe bronchospasm following administration) is suspected, discontinue use (avoid levalbuterol as well)"
